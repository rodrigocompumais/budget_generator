## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A), reflecting the reliability and professionalism of technology and services. Chosen to avoid the cliché of green in budget apps, while still providing a serious feel.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E6E9F2), which ensures a comfortable contrast for reading and maintaining the dark color scheme.
- Accent color: Orange (#D97706), offering a vibrant contrast to guide the user’s focus and highlight the call-to-action elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for both headlines and body text
- Use flat, minimalist icons to represent different services and functionalities within the budget.
- The layout should be clean and well-structured, providing a clear hierarchy and easy navigation for both desktop and mobile.
- Subtle animations, like smooth transitions and loading indicators, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
